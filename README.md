# Simon Game
## Overview
The Simon Game is a modern interpretation of the classic memory enhancement game introduced in the late 1970s.
Designed with a sleek, responsive interface, the game challenges players to remember and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors.
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project offers an engaging way to test and improve memory skills through a simple yet captivating gameplay experience.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The game interface dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent gaming experience across devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose between Easy and Hard modes. Easy mode replays all previous sequences before adding a new one, while Hard mode presents only the new sequence, increasing the memory challenge.
- **Sound Effects:** Each color in the game has a corresponding sound that plays when the color is highlighted, enhancing the sensory experience and aiding in the memorization process. An additional sound indicates when the player has made an incorrect sequence choice.
- **Dynamic User Interaction:** The game responds to both keyboard and mouse inputs, making it accessible and easy to interact with.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Structured the game's layout with semantic elements, creating a robust and accessible DOM structure.
- **CSS:** Styled the game using modern CSS practices, including Flexbox for layout adjustments and media queries for responsive design. Custom animations and transitions enhance the visual impact and user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Powered the game logic with JavaScript, utilizing jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling. The script includes functions for sequence generation, user input validation, and sound playback, providing a full-featured interactive environment.

## How It Works
1. **Game Initialization:** Upon loading the game, players are greeted with a start screen where they can select their preferred difficulty level.
2. **Sequence Generation:** The game randomly generates a sequence of colors that the player must memorize. In Hard mode, each new round presents only the latest color, while Easy mode replays the entire sequence.
3. **User Interaction:** Players replicate the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons. Each button press triggers visual and auditory feedback to confirm the action.
4. **Progression and Difficulty:** The game increases in complexity with each successful round, adding more colors to the sequence. Incorrect sequences trigger a game-over state, and players can choose to restart and try to beat their high score.
